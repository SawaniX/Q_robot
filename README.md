## Q learning algorithm for mobile robot path finding
***
### Assumptions:

The purpose of the project is to train algorithm which allows robot to find the exit of the room. I created environment which is used for training the Q matrix.

### Environment:

In the 'game.py' file we can find source code with environment and robot used for Q matrix training. It is created with PyGame library, we can easily add, remove and change room parameters, like walls and obstacles.

### Algorithm:

I implemented Q learning algorithm for this problem. Source code is located in the 'Q_learning.py' file.

### Usage:

Trained Q-learning matrix can be used in real mobile robot for finding path to the exit of the room.
